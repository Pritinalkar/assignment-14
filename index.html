        The Indian Premier League (IPL), also known as the TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons, 
        is a men's Twenty20 (T20) cricket league held annually in India.
        Founded by the BCCI in 2007, the league features ten city-based franchise teams.[3][4] 
        The IPL usually takes place during the summer, between March and May each year.
         It has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme, resulting in fewer international 
         cricket tours occurring during the IPL seasons.[5] <br>
         The IPL is by far the most popular cricket league in the world; in 2014, it ranked sixth in
        average attendance among all sports leagues.[6] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting
        event to be broadcast live on YouTube.[7][8] Inspired by the success of the IPL, other Indian 
        sports leagues have been established.

    <p class="text1">
        On 13 September 2007,[25] following India's victory at the 2007 T20 World Cup,[26] the BCCI
         announced a franchise based Twenty20 cricket competition known as the Indian Premier League.
          The inaugural season was scheduled to start in April 2008, commencing with a "high-profile
           ceremony" in New Delhi. BCCI Vice-president Lalit Modi, who led the IPL initiative, provided 
           details of the tournament, including its format, prize money, franchise revenue system, and 
           squad composition rules. The league, to be managed by a seven-man governing council, would also
            serve as the qualifying mechanism for that year's Champions League Twenty20.[25] <br>
            To determine team ownership, an auction for the franchises was held on 24 January 2008.
            The reserve prices for the eight franchises totalled $400 million,[24] but the auction ultimately
            raised $723.59 million.[27] The league officially commenced in April 2008, featuring Chennai Super
            Kings (CSK), Mumbai Indians (MI), Delhi Daredevils (DD), Kings XI Punjab (KXIP), Deccan Chargers
             (DC), Rajasthan Royals (RR), Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB)
