        The Indian Premier League (IPL), also known as the TATA IPL for sponsorship reasons, 
        is a men's Twenty20 (T20) cricket league held annually in India.
        Founded by the BCCI in 2007, the league features ten city-based franchise teams.[3][4] 
        The IPL usually takes place during the summer, between March and May each year.
         It has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme, resulting in fewer international 
         cricket tours occurring during the IPL seasons.[5] <br>
         The IPL is by far the most popular cricket league in the world; in 2014, it ranked sixth in
        average attendance among all sports leagues.[6] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting
        event to be broadcast live on YouTube.[7][8] Inspired by the success of the IPL, other Indian 
        sports leagues have been established.
